## Description
Project for identifying characteristics that are assocatiated with an individual making more or less than $50,000 a year. Constructing a pipeline for modeling of this dataset. 

## Background Information
The United States Census Bureau leads the countryâ€™s Federal Statistical System; its primary
responsibility is to collect demographic and economic data about America to help inform
strategic initiatives. Every ten years, the census is conducted to collect and organize information
regarding the US population to effectively allocate billions of dollars of funding to various
endeavors (e.g., the building and maintenance of hospitals, schools, fire departments,
transportation infrastructure, etc.). Additionally, the collection of census information helps to
examine the demographic characteristics of subpopulations across the country.

## Data
Sample dataset from US Census archive for ~ 300,000 individuals. The archive contains 4 files in ``/data/``
1. census_income_learn.csv (data for model training).
2. census_income_test.csv (data for model testing).
3. census_income_metadata.txt (metadata for both datasets).
4. census_income_additional_info.pdf (supplemental information).

### Features

## Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
    - Numerical and/or graphical representation of the data
2. Data Preparation
    - Cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering
3. Data Modeling
    - Construction of machine learning models
4. Model Assessment
    - Model selection process based on evaluation of model performance
5. Results & Conclusions
    - Key findings and recommendations
